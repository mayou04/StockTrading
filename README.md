## Changes outside of the dao:
* In /src/main/webapp/viewAddOrder.jsp, changed line 35 to name="orderPercentage"
* Added parameter private String date into the /src/main/java/model/Stock.java with getter and setter methods so that OrderPriceHistory can be properly displayed.
* In /src/main/java/resources/EditCustomerController.java changed customerID to customerId in line 39. This is because the customerId was incorrectly named and thus could not be retrieved properly.
* In /src/main/java/resources/DeleteCustomerController.java changed customerID to customerId in line 38. This is because the customerId was incorrectly named and thus could not be retrieved properly.
* Added setters and getters into /src/main/java/model/Account.java. This is because account did not have any ways to set and get the private variables.
* In /src/main/java/resources/GetCustomersController.java removed searchKeyword from method dao.getCustomers() in line 45. Since the keyword is null and thus makes the query retrieve no Customers.
* In /src/main/webapp/ShowStocks.jsp added a new line after line 17, inserting <th>Price</th>, and line 27 (previously line 26) inserted <td>${cd.price}</td>. Added prices to the show stock table.
* Added new variable 'private String priceDate' to /src/main/java/model/Stock.java with getter and setter methods so they can be modified.
* Changed values to begin 2000 end 2030 in /src/main/webapp/viewSalesReport.jsp to make it easier to select stock summary, as current dates set are from 2025.
* Changed doGet() from /src/main/java/resources/GetSalesReportController.java to properly gather data and pass it to the JSP, setting the header properly.

  		protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		String year = request.getParameter("year");
		String month = request.getParameter("month");
		SalesDao dao = new SalesDao();
		List<RevenueItem> items = dao.getSalesReport(month, year);

		request.setAttribute("items", items);
		request.setAttribute("heading", "Sales Report for " + month + "/" + year);

		RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("showSalesReport.jsp");
		rd.forward(request, response);
		}
